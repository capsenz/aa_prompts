# Aleph Alpha Prompts
Welcome to AA Prompts!

With this repository, I want to enable you to use Aleph Alpha AI models as well as possible. If you are new to Aleph Alpha and LLMs, I recommend checking out our documentation to get a basic understanding of 
- [Luminous Models](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/docs/introduction/luminous/)
- [Prompting](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/docs/introduction/few_shot_prompting/)
- [Explainability](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/docs/category/explainability/)

## Contributing
If you have some nice prompts for our models, feel free to contribute to this repo and make suggestions.
